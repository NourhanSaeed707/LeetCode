# What is BFS?
- BFS stands for  **Breadth First Search**. It is also known as **level order traversal**. The **Queue data structure** is used for the Breadth First Search traversal. When we use the BFS algorithm for the traversal in a graph, we can consider any node as a root node.

## BFS example
- Let's see how the Breadth First Search algorithm works with an example. We use an undirected graph with 5 vertices.

Let 0 be the starting node or source node. First, we enqueue it in the visited queue and all its adjacent nodes in the queue.
